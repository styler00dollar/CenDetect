# CenDetect

A repository to detect degradation in images and masking such areas.

**Warning: Do not share modified images, since randomly grabbed images are used for dataset purposes. If I notice a growing amount of bad images in my dataset, I will probably stop sharing anything.**

# Features
- No Tensorflow (easy to install, no GPU restrictions by forcing certain versions of CUDA, no very specific env requirements)
- FP16 (less VRAM usage and potentially higher speed)
- Uses an Nvidia GPU if there is one available, if not, then CPU
- Big dataset with augmentations
- Multiple architectures (since it uses mmdetection as a base)

# Running the compiled version (Windows)
Just download from ``releases`` and open the ``.bat`` file. You can also edit that file to change the startup parameters, like ``confidence`` and ``fp16``.

# Running from source
There are 2 ways to install it, with and without Anaconda. If you don't want to use Anaconda, install python. Python is already preinstalled in Linux based distros. Anaconda is recommended. If you do not use Anaconda, then you maybe need to install CUDA in Linux yourself. Inside Windows, it seems to be a requirement to install CUDA.

The exact version of Python and the other packages shouldn't be very important, but make sure that [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) does support the installed PyTorch package. Currently it ``supports up to Pytorch 1.8``. ``Pytorch 1.9 currently is not compatible`` and will result in errors.

## Linux
```
# Installing dependencies with pip
pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.8.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install opencv-python tqdm numpy
# or installing with Anaconda
conda create -n mmdetection python=3.9 -y
conda activate mmdetection
conda install pytorch==1.8.0 torchvision==0.9.0 torchaudio==0.8.0 cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge -y
conda install -c anaconda numpy -y
conda install tqdm -y
conda install -c conda-forge opencv -y

# Installing mmcv
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.8 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu111/torch1.8.0/index.html

# Installing mmdetection
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection
cd mmdetection
pip install -e .
```

## Windows
```
# Install PyTorch, numpy, tqdm, OpenCV and mmcv with the commands above
# Download and install Cuda 11.1 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.1.0-download-archive)
# Reboot
# Download Build Tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
# Select the first thing with C++ inside the installer and install
# Reboot

# If Anaconda is used, activate env
conda activate mmdetection

pip install mmcv-full
# Download the official mmdetection Code (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)
# Change `mmdetection/requirements/runtime.txt` file to `pycocotools` instead of `pycocotools; platform_system == "Linux"` and `pycocotools-windows; platform_system == "Windows"`.
# If you don't change this, it will say that it couldn't find the package "pycocotools"
# run install within the mmdetection directory
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
```
python det.py [--fp16] [--confidence <float>] [--input_path <string>] [--output_path <string>]
```

# Creating an .exe with pyinstaller
```
# Do the steps for Windows above
# If conda is used, uninstall conda Pillow to avoid problems
conda uninstall Pillow -y
# or uninstall with pip
pip uninstall Pillow
pip install --upgrade Pillow

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --hidden-import=mmcv._ext --hidden-import torchvision det.py
```

# FAQ
Q: AMD GPU?

A: No, you bought a bad GPU. Only Nvidia GPUs do have good support for this kind of task. Code will use CPU instead. It may be possible with Vulkan or ONNX, but this requires some work and is most likely also slower, [since Vulkan showed around half of the performance of CUDA](https://github.com/n00mkrad/flowframes/blob/main/Benchmarks.md). If you *really* want to try it and have a GPU that is ROCm compatible, install Arch linux and [follow these steps](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/53738#issuecomment-813058293). Compiling ROCm and Pytorch (ROCm version) will probably take like 9 hours in total. Around 6 for ROCm and around 3 for Pytorch. No gurantee it will even work, since my attempt to get EfficientNet working failed. Only try this if you have an RX5xx or a Vega, have a lot of time and you know what you are doing. I heard that DirectML does support PyTorch, but I never tested it. It requires ONNX, which can't be generated without modifying mmdetection, since the forward function does require additional information like ground truth bounding box for example. Currently only supporting either CPU or CUDA.

Q: Supported file formats?

A: Technically everything that OpenCV supports, but glob currently only searches for JPG and PNG.

# Acknowledgements
Was trained with the [OpenMMLab Detection Toolbox](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Mostly unmodified, but custom code was written to use the trained models. The default Code does require a ``.json`` during inference. Also adding other things like a replacement for `img_metas` and a `fp16` feature. More infos in the code.  

Inspriration from [natethegreate/hent-AI](https://github.com/natethegreate/hent-AI). Mostly giving ideas on which custom code was written.
